# Desintegrated RSA

#### easy

Leonard is starting to fell his age and his sight hasn't been improving lately...
He gave me a part of his private key to decipher a message he received but he must have written 2 bits wrongely.
Would you be able to recover the private key for me and decipher his message please ?
